    <h1>In Science Journalism, More Women Seek Graduate Training, More Men Get Jobs</h1>

    <h2>A diverse range of factors, including career shifts, attitude, family and goals, seems to influence the decisions science journalists make about grad school and jobs. But due to a changing field, it can be hard to draw conclusions about those decisions.</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s a familiar scenario by now. A guest speaker comes to class, often a veteran editor or reporter at a science publication, and remarks, &rdquo;Wow, all women, how did that happen?&ldquo;</p> 

<p>I&rsquo;m one of 11 current graduate students in the Science, Health and Environmental Reporting Program (fondly referred to as SHERP) at New York University&rsquo;s Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute. All 11 of us are women.</p> 

<p>The fact that we are all women is one that I am constantly aware of, and one that my classmates and I refer to routinely. It comes up in conversations with others, in how often members of our class pitch stories related to women in science, and in our general social dynamics and ability to relate to each other through shared experiences as women.</p> 

<p>When people outside our program register surprise at our all-female cast, I am reminded that gender composition of our class is an exception, that it doesn&rsquo;t carry over into the wild world of real, money&ndash;making science journalism. It&rsquo;s a reminder I also get from the fact that a majority of our guest speakers, a majority of our professors and a majority of the names I see on the tops of mastheads are men.</p> 

<p>One speculation that I often hear from veteran science journalists about the gender imbalance in our grad program is that the field is changing, and that more and more women are entering it.</p>

<p>I wanted to find out if that was really true. In general, I wanted to learn more about what exactly is going on with gender with science journalism. I&rsquo;ve heard a lot of anecdotal observations and hypotheses about the balance between women and men in this field. &rdquo;There are more women reporters, but more men at the top.&ldquo; &rdquo;The gender breakdown of science journalism graduate programs has skewed towards women over time.&ldquo; &rdquo;More men work on staff, but more women freelance.&ldquo;</p> 

<p>But what does the data say?</p> 

<p>&mdash;</p>

<h2>Women have dominated science journalism grad programs from the start, more men get staff jobs, more women freelance</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at some key findings:</p>

<h2>1. Since the start of the top three science journalism graduate programs, women have consistently stayed at around 75 percent of enrolled students.</h2>

<h2>2. While women make up a majority of science journalism graduate students, men make up a majority of staff editors and journalists. Furthermore, positions with the words &rdquo;chief&ldquo;, &rdquo;senior&ldquo; and &rdquo;executive&ldquo; had more men, while positions with the words &rdquo;associate&ldquo;, &rdquo;managing&ldquo; and &rdquo;assistant&ldquo; had more women. More men who work for publications also write books.</h2>

<p>Analyzed 147 recent grads, 112 women, 35 men from the 2010-2014 classes of science writing graduate programs at NYU, MIT and UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&mdash;</p>

<h2>Why are more women going to grad school?</h2> 

<p>The roughly 3:1 gender breakdown of all three graduate programs is no coincidence. I spoke to Dan Fagin, director of SHERP, and Rob Irion, director of the Santa Cruz program, and both told me that, on average, the gender ratio of enrolled students comes out as roughly identical to that of applicants&mdash;somewhere in the range of 75 percent.</p>

<p>Neither could say definitively why more women are applying to science journalism graduate programs, though both speculated that the reasons might be related to career shifts and differences in attitude.</p> 

<p>The fact that more women are entering science journalism graduate programs may be because they are leaving other fields of science, according to Fagin and Irion. As a career adjacent to the sciences, science journalism often makes an attractive career option for people who enjoy learning about science, but have realized they don&rsquo;t want to do research.</p>

<p>&rdquo;We may all have our pet theories as to why we get applications from so many more women than men, but the truth is none of us really know for sure,&ldquo; said Fagin. &rdquo;I do think it&rsquo;s possible that the hierarchical nature of science careers and the sexism, both explicit and implicit, makes climbing the science ladder difficult.&ldquo;</p> 

<p>Of course, noted Fagin, that&rsquo;s not to say journalism is bias&ndash;free. &rdquo;We certainly still have our problems,&ldquo; he said. &rdquo;But I do think journalism is less clogged by sexism than academic sciences.&ldquo;</p>

<p>&rdquo;I think women are maybe put off by academic culture and want to seek something else,&ldquo; said Alexandra Ossola, a freelance science journalist who graduated from SHERP this past December. &rdquo;Journalism perhaps taps into a different sort of need for people who don&rsquo;t want to be confined to a lab for the rest of their lives.&ldquo;</p>

<p>Furthermore, science journalists who have left academic sciences seem to be disproportionately from the life sciences, which has more women than other science disciplines, according to Irion.</p> 

<p>He has noticed that roughly 75 percent of the applicants to Santa Cruz come from a background in biology.  &rdquo;Among the sciences, biology is the most gender&ndash;balanced, with probably a reasonably close approximation to a 50/50 ratio,&ldquo; said Irion. &rdquo;We get people from ecology, neuroscience, cell biology, molecular biology, genetics&mdash;in those fields, women in academia have made far greater strides than they have in physical sciences or engineering.&ldquo;</p>
 
<p>The students Irion advises at Santa Cruz perhaps yield particular insight into the transition from academic science to science journalism: the program requires that applicants have at least an undergraduate degree in science, as well as research experience. Roughly two&ndash;thirds of the applicants to the Santa Cruz program have a master&rsquo;s or doctorate degree in science.</p>

<p>As for why more biologists are drawn to science journalism, Irion said that&rsquo;s less clear. If he had to speculate, he would guess that biologists as a whole are maybe a bit more willing to consider alternative career trajectories. &rdquo;The physical sciences and engineering career trajectories seem to be a bit more sharply defined,&ldquo; he said. &rdquo;Once people get further along in that trajectory, they might generally be more loathe to leave it.&ldquo;</p>

<p>Irion suggested that men and women might also have different career pressures influencing their decisions to switch to science journalism: Women may be more open-minded about their professional destinations, while men might have more of a one&ndash;track mind.</p> 

<p>&rdquo;I have felt for a while now, just by virtue of having many scores of conversations over the years, that women in general from the science sphere seem more willing to consider alternative career trajectories than men,&ldquo; he said. &rdquo;Is that something that is more typically drilled into men, who want to make a mark as a scientist or engineer, versus women, who still want to do something extremely meaningful or impactful, but are more willing to consider doing that in other ways?&ldquo;</p> 

<p>Irion didn&rsquo;t know for certain, but intuitively, he feels it could be a factor.</p> 

<p>Aside from career shifts, the gender disparity in science journalism graduate programs might have to do with differences in outlook between men and women.</p>

<p>&rdquo;Anecdotally, many women I hear from are very collaborative, and very secure about acknowledging what they don&rsquo;t know,&ldquo; said Fagin. &rdquo;I think an instinct for collaboration and willingness to acknowledge that you don&rsquo;t know everything tend to make you more interested in graduate journalism training.&ldquo;</p> 

<p>Awareness of what they don&rsquo;t know might also put women at a disadvantage, leading them to second&ndash;guess themselves or not feel entitled to ask for more money.</p> 

<p>&rdquo;Certainly I see some men who are very quick to acknowledge what they don&rsquo;t know, and some women who maybe need to better acknowledge what they don&rsquo;t know,&ldquo; said Fagin. &rdquo;But I think women can be quicker to have imposter syndrome and undervalue their knowledge compared to men.&ldquo;</p>

<p>From her personal observations, Ossola agrees that may be the case. She has seen women journalists falter before seeking out job opportunities or pitching stories because they don&rsquo;t feel like they don&rsquo;t know enough.</p>
 
<p>&rdquo;You have to fake it to make it,&ldquo; she said, &rdquo;and I think women tend to feel a little less comfortable with that. They feel like they don&rsquo;t have the credentials to back them up.&ldquo;</p> 

<p>That uncertainty sometimes leads women to settle for less money too, said Ossola. She recalled a conversation with an editor, who told her that when women pitch stories, they rarely ever ask for more money, while men ask for more money all the time.</p> 

<p>Ossola also thinks women specifically seek out mentorships to propel themselves forward, which might be another reason why more women go to grad school. &rdquo;You can show up at journalist events, and you can make connections,&ldquo; she said. &rdquo;Obviously men value that too, but I think women especially feel heartened, and so much more legit, if they have that.&ldquo;</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<h2>So where are the women grads going?</h2>

<p>One way to account for the gap between the majority of women in science journalism grad programs and the majority of men hired at science publications is to look at the main alternative to working a staff job: freelancing.</p>
 
<p>The data I gathered suggests that more women grads are freelancing than men grads. What is less clear, however, is what might be motivating people&rsquo;s decisions to freelance. Are they actively choosing it, or are they settling for freelancing because they can&rsquo;t find jobs?</p> 

<p>The answer seems to be trending towards the former&mdash;more science journalists are actively choosing to freelance, for various reasons. As such, it&rsquo;s difficult to make any value judgments about what it means that more recent women grads are freelancing. One possible implication is that this could mean fewer women are driving broad&ndash;strokes trends in science journalism because freelance journalists have no input over the large&ndash;scale vision and content selection of publications. Overall, however, freelancing seems to be an increasingly competitive alternative to getting a staff job.</p> 
 
<p>&rdquo;Maybe ten years ago, there was an unsaid assumption that if you were freelancing, you couldn&rsquo;t get a staff job. That is simply not true anymore,&ldquo; said Fagin. &rdquo;Every year some of the very best, most powerhouse SHERP graduates have absolutely no interest in staff writing, and couldn&rsquo;t be happier being freelancers.&ldquo;</p>

<p>Furthermore, freelancers are not necessarily at an economic disadvantage, according Fagin. &rdquo;Under the new financial models, some freelancers are doing much better than their staff counterparts,&ldquo; he said.</p> 

<p>People have a diverse range of reasons for wanting to freelance, but one major motivation has to do with family&mdash;which could explain why more recent women grads are freelancing.</p> 

<p>If you look at the pool of men and women students from Santa Cruz equally and ask what is the likelihood that a woman or a man from that pool is going to immediately seek out a freelance career upon graduating, it&rsquo;s definitely higher for women, said Irion.</p>

<p>&rdquo;We receive many applications from women who have decided that the academic trajectory is not consistent with the life that they wish to lead, particularly with regard to raising a family,&ldquo; he said. &rdquo;This comes up very overtly in conversation, with at least one to two women students of mine every year without fail, and not from men.&ldquo;</p> 

<p>Women with near&ndash;future plans to raise a family also often have a partner who can support them financially, according to Irion. &rdquo;If I were to put a number on it, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a 75 percent range of women freelancers out of our program who have a partner who is already working,&ldquo; he said.</p>

<p>Family is certainly not the only consideration for science journalism grad students who seek out freelancing, however. Certainly, family is one salient factor, said Fagin, but he doesn&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s all of it.</p> 

<p>&rdquo;If someone has kids at home, that becomes a huge factor. We still have family structures where, whether we state it explicitly or not, we seem to have a double standard about who&rsquo;s expected to stay at home,&ldquo; said Fagin. &rdquo;But I see plenty of young, single women who just really want to freelance. They don&rsquo;t want to be tied down to doing one kind of story in one kind of place.&ldquo;</p>

<p>Fagin thinks freelancing affords journalists the opportunity to do deeper, more diverse work. &rdquo;Often people go into science journalism because they don&rsquo;t want to be bored and they like different projects,&ldquo; he said. &rdquo;People can be really attracted to freelancing for those reasons. They want to do deeper work and don&rsquo;t want to be beholden to daily headlines.&ldquo;</p>

<p>Graduated: NYU 2014</p>
<p>Current job: Freelancing, writes for <a href="http://www.popsci.com/">Popular Science three times a week</a></p>
<p>Why freelancing: &rdquo;I got the impression, whether it&rsquo;s correct or not, that no staff job would give me the flexibility to cover the range of topics I wanted to as well as being satisfying enough for me from a story perspective. I want to tell stories that matter&mdash;deep stories that give insight into an issue or subculture you otherwise might not have known about.&ldquo;</p>
<p>Why Popular Science: &rdquo;The Pop Sci gig is essential. It allows me to have financial security and flexibility of being a freelancer while still having steady money.&ldquo;</p>

<p>Graduated: MIT 2013</p>
<p>Current job: Staff Writer at <a href="http://insideclimatenews.org/">Inside Climate News</a></p>
<p>Why Inside Climate News: &rdquo;I had an internship at Inside Climate News and then they offered me a job immediately after&hellip; at the time I was applying to other full&ndash;time staff jobs, but if none of those panned out, I was hoping to freelance in between. I like the stability of it for sure. I think I also wanted a built&ndash;in component of mentorship.&ldquo;</p>

<p>Graduated: Santa Cruz 2014</p>
<p>Current job: Freelancing</p>
<p>Why freelancing: &rdquo;I spent five years in a job, working in biotech, before science journalism. I was at the same job for the whole time and I hated it. I&rsquo;m really cautious now about full time jobs I take because I know how much it sucks to have a 9 to 5 job that you really don&rsquo;t like. For me, it&rsquo;s been really nice to be able to pick and choose assignments I want to take, as well as my schedule. It&rsquo;s been very liberating. But I&rsquo;m still keeping my options open and applying to staff jobs that seem like a good fit when I see them.&ldquo;</p>

<p>Current job: Staff reporter at <a href="https://www.genomeweb.com/">GenomeWeb</a>, freelancing on the side</p>
<p>Why GenomeWeb: &rdquo;Freelancing, or at least my approach to it, wasn&rsquo;t able to meet all of my financial needs by itself&hellip; Working at GenomeWeb allows me to do longer freelance stories, and actually get out and spend more time reporting stories instead of getting it done as quickly as possible so I get paid.&ldquo;</p>
<p>Why freelancing: &rdquo;I wanted to be able to write my own stories.&ldquo;</p>

<p>Current job: Staff reporter at the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/pages/science/index.html">New York Times</a></p>
<p>Why New York Times: &rdquo;I&rsquo;m 23, a little bit younger than many early-career science journalists, and I think still at an age where I care a lot about what my parents think. I wanted to go into a kind of job that would make my parents happy and not worry about me so much&hellip; My parents are immigrants and there was definitely some pressure to be a doctor, or be a lawyer. For me, striving for places that would make my parents proud was definitely a driving force.&ldquo;</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<h2>So is it a problem that there are more women entering grad programs and more men leading science publications?</h2>

<p>Yes&hellip; and no.</p> 

<p>Each of the recent graduates I spoke with said that, on an individual level, gender has not played a role in his or her opportunity to succeed as a science journalist. They all agreed, however, science journalism at large needs more diversity all around.</p>

<p>&rdquo;Our graduates&mdash;the people who have gone through the Santa Cruz program&mdash;and I have perceived no barriers for women who wish to be candidates for the really prominent staff jobs or to ultimately move up through editorial ranks,&ldquo; said Irion. &rdquo;I have not received any direct feedback from our alumni that they did not get a job because of their gender.&ldquo;</p>

<p>Fagin similarly feels that women SHERP graduates have consistently been successful at climbing the ranks. Looking only at science journalists under the age of 40 might yield a different picture of the field, he suggested. &rdquo;I&rsquo;d like to think there is less latent sexism, that staff jobs for science journalists under 40 would more closely reflect the gender breakdown of grad programs,&ldquo; he said.</p>

<p>Both Irion and Fagin said they don&rsquo;t consider the gender breakdown of their programs when admitting students. However, they are aware that the gender imbalance can impact students&rsquo; experiences.</p>

<p>&rdquo;The real world has men and women in it, and I would like SHERP to reflect the real world,&ldquo; said Fagin.</p> 

<p>Across the board, the women graduates I spoke with seemed hopeful about women&rsquo;s role in their field. &rdquo;Women tend to be driven enough, and able to figure out what works for them well enough, that they are able to ascend to more senior levels,&ldquo; said Ossola. &rdquo;Maybe they are not at the top of the top, but I think it&rsquo;s only a matter of time. Or at least I hope so.&ldquo;</p>


<p>That said, things are far from perfect and there are bigger reasons why it&rsquo;s a problem that women graduates are entering a field that is still led by men, according to Ossola. &rdquo;The problem lies in the fact that men are still the ones that sit in higher&ndash;paying, higher&ndash;power positions deciding the direction of a lot of publications. The balance of editors in chief needs to be more reflective of who&rsquo;s actually doing work in the field,&ldquo; she said.</p>

<p>In addition to needing more women at executive levels, science journalism needs more diversity overall, such as racial and geographic diversity, said Calderone. &rdquo;I think we need more women in charge of assigning stories and being in those higher positions,&ldquo; she told me. &rdquo;We also need more diversity in terms of race. And I think most journalists tend to be concentrated in big, coastal cities.&ldquo;</p>

<p>More diversity all around will only enhance the field for everyone, said Ossola. &rdquo;I can say this as a white girl who attended a liberal arts college&mdash;there are a lot of people like me,&ldquo; she said. &rdquo;Every field could use people with different perspectives to bring in what interests them. Bring them all in. I don&rsquo;t think there are people who would admit in a profession as liberal as ours that they&rsquo;re threatened by that. But they shouldn&rsquo;t be&mdash;you are you, you have experiences that you bring to the table, and there&rsquo;s plenty of room for all of it.&ldquo;</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<h3>Limitations to this project:</h3>

<li>As discussed in the piece, it&rsquo;s difficult to compare how freelance and staff jobs actually compare. It would be helpful to look at actual salaries. Another confounding factor is contributing writers and editors versus full&ndash;time writers and editors. I counted contributors on the same level as regular staff members.</li>
<li>The sample sizes for men and women graduates were very different. Sample sizes for men were much smaller, which makes it difficult to confidently draw strong comparisons between men and women from the data.</li>
<li>Publication mastheads might be out of date. When possible, I fact checked with Twitter, personal websites and alumni pages, but given that science journalists are notoriously peripatetic, it&rsquo;s possible that those may be out of date as well.</li> 
<li>I assigned genders to people based on whatever bios I could find, as well as names and pictures. However, it&rsquo;s possible that people have different gender identities than I accounted for.</li>
